# FSMonitoringKit

Flexible Cocoa file system monitoring library with guaranteed fine-grained change events (based on FSEvents)

Note: the code is stable, but this hasn't actually been published as a pod yet.

Also note that currently all FS operations are done on the main queue; this obviously needs to change.
